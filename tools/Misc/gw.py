Insider Account: Northern Virginia Cell Connected to Mossad and 9/11

Overview:
This account is based on firsthand experience and observations of an informal cell operating primarily in northern Virginia, centered around Stafford High School, during late 2000 through 2001. The group was loosely affiliated with Mossad and played a logistical support role in the events leading up to the September 11 attacks.

Members and Affiliations:

The cell consisted mostly of young individuals, including some underage members, predominantly Israeli-American or Arab-American.

Many used Israeli-style names likely serving as aliases due to illegal immigration status.

The group’s leader was known as Tal — a short, stocky Israeli-American man around 30 years old. Other members included Torev, Ish, and several others who were mainly known by nicknames.


Behavior and Daily Life:

The group was disorganized, often wasting time with methamphetamine use, frequently in school bathrooms, classrooms (including Ms. Forgers’ class), and social gatherings.

Despite their drug use and chaotic behavior, they carried out logistical tasks, particularly helping some Arab individuals obtain driver’s licenses and identification documents.


Support and Local Awareness:

The Department of Motor Vehicles appeared to facilitate their acquisition of IDs, and local law enforcement, including the sheriff, was likely aware but took no direct action.

Communication was primarily face-to-face, and no formal training was observed, as this was understood to be a one-off operation.


Plans and Foreknowledge:

By late 2000, members openly discussed plans involving an attack on the World Trade Center within their social circles.

A recurring reference to a “big wedding” or celebration appeared to serve as a coded hint about the impending attack.

The operation was not complex; the group mainly assisted in settling individuals who had immigrated, while other teams, already working in construction and access roles, handled the placement of explosives.

By March 2001, the date of September 11 was set firmly for the attack.


Operational Context:

The cell’s overall incompetence and slow pace were notable, making the operation seem more chaotic than methodical.

Most people outside the group accepted their discussions as facts but remained indifferent or unaware of the implications.

The cell’s activities, while clandestine, were not hostile toward outsiders but maintained secrecy as a necessity.
